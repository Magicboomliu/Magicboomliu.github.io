### Ph.D Candidate
Room 307, South Building 5  
Dept. of System Control and Engineering  
Tokyo Institue of Technology.
Tokyo, Japan


Biography
======
I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [Okutomi Lab](http://www.ok.sc.e.titech.ac.jp/), Dept. of System Control and Engineering, Tokyo Institue of Technology, advised by [Prof.Masatoshi Okutomi](http://www.ok.sc.e.titech.ac.jp/mem/mxo/okutomi.html). Before that, I obtained my M.S. degree from the same school and my B.S. degree from South China University of Technology in July 2020. 

My research interests lie in 3D vision and autonomous driving perception. Previously, I did some research on [Stereo Matching](http://www.ok.sc.e.titech.ac.jp/res/DeepSM/main.html) and 3D detections, now I am focused on generative models.
