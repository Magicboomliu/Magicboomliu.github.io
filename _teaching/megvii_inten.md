1. Focus on Parking Slot detection and segmentation for autonomous drving.
2. Add a angle constrain to the corners of the parking slot which improve the recall rate of parking slot detection by 10%.
3. Impose a novel training strategy for data augmentation which make full use of the limited training data, which greatly improve the detection at ill-position like image edges and occluded regions. It was finally accepted by Megvii as the IPM pipeline for automatic parking algorithm.
